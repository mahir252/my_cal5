     <h1>FORCE</h1>
     <br><br><br>

     <h3>
        Force (Bol) in Physics
1. What is Force? (Definition)

In physics, force is defined as:

A force is a push or a pull which can change the shape, size, speed, direction, or state of rest of a body.

In simple words:

Force is anything that can:

Start motion

Stop motion

Change speed

Change direction

Deform an object

⚠️ Important:

Force is a vector quantity

It has magnitude and direction

SI unit of force is newton (N)
     </h3>

     <br><br><br>

     <h3>2. Effects of Force

A force can:

Change the state of rest or motion

Change speed (increase or decrease)

Change direction of motion

Change shape or size of an object

Example:

Kicking a football → changes speed

Catching a moving ball → stops motion

Pressing clay → changes shape</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>3. Types of Force

Forces are mainly classified into two broad types:</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>A. Contact Forces
Definition:

Forces that act only when two bodies are in physical contact are called contact forces.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>1. Muscular Force
Definition:

The force exerted by muscles of living beings is called muscular force.

Examples:

Lifting a bag

Pushing a table

Pulling a cart

⚠️ Acts only when muscles are used.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>2. Frictional Force
Definition:

The force that opposes the relative motion between two surfaces in contact is called friction.

Examples:

Walking without slipping

Brakes stopping a car

Rubbing hands to produce heat

⚠️ Direction: Always opposite to motion</h3>

<br><br><br>


<h3>B. Non-Contact Forces
Definition:

Forces that act without physical contact between objects are called non-contact forces.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>1. Gravitational Force
Definition:

The force by which the Earth attracts objects towards its center is called gravitational force.

Examples:

A stone falling to the ground

Rain falling from clouds

Objects having weight

⚠️ Always attractive in nature.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>2. Magnetic Force
Definition:

The force exerted by a magnet on magnetic materials or another magnet is called magnetic force.

Examples:

Magnet attracting iron nails

Repulsion between like poles of magnets

Compass needle aligning north-south

⚠️ Can be attractive or repulsive.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>3. Electrostatic Force
Definition:

The force between electrically charged bodies is called electrostatic force.

Examples:

Balloon sticking to a wall after rubbing

Paper bits attracted by a charged comb

Repulsion between like charges

⚠️ Acts even in vacuum.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>4. Applied Force
Definition:

A force that is applied to an object by a person or another object is called applied force.

Examples:

Pushing a door

Pulling a rope

Kicking a football</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>5. Normal Force
Definition:

The force exerted by a surface perpendicular to the object resting on it is called normal force.

Examples:

A book resting on a table

A person standing on the ground

⚠️ Always acts perpendicular to the surface.</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>6. Tension Force
Definition:

The force transmitted through a string, rope, or cable when it is pulled tight is called tension.

Examples:

Hanging a bucket from a rope

Pulling a load with a rope</h3>

<br><br><br>

<h3>7. Air Resistance (Drag Force)
Definition:

The force that opposes the motion of an object moving through air is called air resistance.

Examples:

Falling feather reaching ground slowly

Parachute slowing down a skydiver</h3>
