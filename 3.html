        <h1>MOTION</h1>
        <br><br>
        <h3>1.Motion (Goti) in Physics
1. Definition of Motion (Goti)

In physics, motion is defined as:

A body is said to be in motion if its position changes with time with respect to a chosen reference point or observer.

Key points you must understand (no shortcuts):

Motion is relative, not absolute.

Without a reference point, motion has no meaning.

Time must be involved.

Example:

A student sitting inside a moving bus is:

At rest with respect to the bus

In motion with respect to the road or trees outside

So, motion depends on who is observing and from where.</h3>
<br><br>

<h3>2. Why Reference Point is Mandatory

Physics does not accept vague statements like:

“The object is moving.”

You must say:

“The object is moving with respect to something.”

Example:

A book on a table:

At rest with respect to the table

In motion with respect to the Sun (because Earth is moving)

This is why we say:

There is no absolute rest or absolute motion in classical mechanics.</h3>

<br><br>
<h3>3. Types of Motion (Prokar of Goti)

In basic physics, motion is mainly classified into the following types:

A. Translational Motion
Definition:

When all points of a body move the same distance in the same direction in the same time, the motion is called translational motion.

The body moves as a whole.

Subtypes of Translational Motion:
1. Rectilinear Motion
Definition:

Motion of a body along a straight line is called rectilinear motion.

Examples:

A car moving on a straight road

A stone falling vertically downward

A train moving on a straight track

This is the simplest form of motion and is heavily used in kinematics.
<br>
2. Curvilinear Motion
Definition:

Motion of a body along a curved path is called curvilinear motion.

Examples:

A thrown ball following a curved path

A car taking a bend on a curved road

Water flowing through a curved pipe

⚠️ Important:

Curvilinear motion is still translational motion

Only the path is curved
<br><br><br>
B. Rotational Motion
Definition:

When a body rotates about a fixed axis, it is said to be in rotational motion.

Here:

The axis may be inside or outside the body

Different points move in circular paths

Examples:

A ceiling fan rotating about its central axis

Earth rotating about its own axis

A wheel rotating around its axle

🔴 Key difference from translational motion:

In rotational motion, different points have different linear speeds
<br>
C. Circular Motion
Definition:

Motion of a body along the circumference of a circle is called circular motion.

Examples:

A stone tied to a string and whirled in a circle

The second hand of a clock

A satellite revolving around Earth

⚠️ Important Concept:

Circular motion is a special case of curvilinear motion

Even if speed is constant, velocity is changing (direction changes)
<br>
D. Oscillatory Motion
Definition:

A motion in which a body moves to and fro about a fixed mean position repeatedly is called oscillatory motion.

Key properties:

There is a mean (equilibrium) position

Motion is periodic

Examples:

Simple pendulum

Swing in a playground

Mass attached to a spring
<br>
E. Periodic Motion
Definition:

A motion that repeats itself after equal intervals of time is called periodic motion.

Examples:

Earth’s revolution around the Sun

Rotation of Earth about its axis

Oscillation of a pendulum

⚠️ Relation:

All oscillatory motions are periodic

But not all periodic motions are oscillatory
<br>
F. Random Motion
Definition:

Motion in which a body moves in an irregular and unpredictable path is called random motion.

Examples:

Motion of gas molecules

Movement of dust particles in air

Brownian motion

This motion has:

No fixed path

No fixed direction

4. Rest and Motion Are Relative

This is an exam-favorite concept.

Statement:

Rest and motion are relative terms and depend on the observer.

Example:

A passenger sleeping in a bus:

At rest relative to the bus

In motion relative to the road

There is no universal frame where everything is at rest.
